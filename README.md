<p align="center"><b>Apex Squirrel Scripts</b></p>

This is a collection of Squirrel scripts for use in Apex Legends. So far, the collection only includes a script for displaying spectator count.

<p align="center"><b>spectator_count.nut</b></p>
The spectator_count.nut script displays the number of spectators currently watching your game. To use the script, simply load it into your game. The spectator count will be displayed as an in-game hint on your screen similer to the interact hint.
